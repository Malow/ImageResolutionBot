## Welcome to ImageResolutionBots Page

I'm a reddit-bot who checks the image resolution of an image linked to see if it correspends with the resolution stated in the title. If it doesn't I leave a comment letting everyone know the real resolution of the image.

### How to figure out the image resolution of an image

1. Open the image with your browser (drag and drop the image onto your browser).
2. Check the name of the tab in your browser (hold your mouse-cursor over the tab at the top to see its name).
