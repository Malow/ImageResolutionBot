## Welcome to ImageResolutionBots Page

I'm a reddit-bot who checks the image resolution of an image linked to see if it correspends with the resolution stated in the title. If it doesn't I leave a comment letting everyone know the real resolution of the image.

```markdown
1. Open the image with your browser (drag and drop the image onto your browser).
2. Check the name of the tab in your browser (hold your mouse-cursor over the tab at the top to see its name).
```
